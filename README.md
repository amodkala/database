# about
### description
This library includes a consensus module (CM) that can be embedded in other projects to enable distributed consensus at scale

### motivation
Creating this library provided an opportunity to use tools I was already familiar with (go, protocol buffers, grpc) to explore open-source tools I found interesting (bufbuild/buf) and learn more about topics I found interesting (distributed systems, kubernetes, databases, networking)
